# 🧠 OpenAI Responses API Hub

Welcome to the **OpenAI Responses API Hub** — a modular, hands-on project designed to help you master the OpenAI Responses API through guided notebooks, real-world examples, and tool integrations.

This repo evolves with each notebook — starting from the basics and gradually integrating advanced features like multimodal inputs, tool use, UI design, and response streaming.
